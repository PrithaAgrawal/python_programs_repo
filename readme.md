# My Python Programs

This repository contains a collection of Python programs I created to practice and learn Python programming. Each program is organized into its own folder.

## List of Programs

1. **adventure_game.py**: A text-based interactive fiction game where players make choices that shape the story's outcome.
2. **binary_search.py**: A Python implementation of the binary search algorithm for efficiently finding elements in a sorted list.
3. **calculator.py**: A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
4. **die_game.py**: A simple dice-rolling game that generates random numbers between 1 and 6.
5. **madlibs_generator.py**: A fun word game where user inputs are used to generate a humorous story.
6. **no_guesser.py**: A number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number with hints.
7. **password_manager.py**: A tool to securely store, retrieve, and manage passwords.
8. **password_strength_tester.py**: A program that evaluates and scores the strength of a given password.
9. **passwords.txt**: A text file used to store passwords managed by the password manager.
10. **quiz_game.py**: A multiple-choice quiz game that tests the user's knowledge on various topics.
11. **rock_paper_scissors.py**: A command-line version of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
12. **story.txt**: A text file containing a story or narrative, potentially used in madlib_generator.py.
13. **tic_tac_toe.py**: A Python implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players.
14. **time_math_challenge.py**: A math quiz game where players solve arithmetic problems under time pressure.

Today, my best friend and I went to the zoo.
We saw a(n) <adjective> <animal> jumping up and down in its tree. 
He <verb (past tense)> <adverb> through the large tunnel that led to its <adjective> <habitat>.
I was so <emotion> because I’ve never seen anything like it before.
The zookeeper told us that its favorite food is <food>, but I didn’t have any <food> with me.
I gave it a(n) <noun> to eat instead.
Next, we went to the petting zoo where we saw a(n) <adjective> <animal>. 
It looked like it needed <noun>. I had fun <verb ending in -ing> with it. 
We decided to buy some <plural noun> and head to our favorite part of the zoo. 
The highlight of the day was when a <adjective> <animal> <verb (past tense)> right in front of us!
